**Market Position:** Oasis is a very early-stage entrant. It is NOT included in the [Sobriety Hub 2026 Buyer's Guide "Big 3"](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/our-blog/2026-buyers-guide-the-big-3-of-sober-living-software) (which covers Sobriety Hub, One Step Software, and Sober Living App). It is not mentioned in the [Vanderburgh Communities sober living software guide](https://vanderburghcommunities.com/knowledge-base/sober-house-management-software/) either. This suggests limited market penetration as of February 2026.

## 2. Bed/Occupancy Management

- **Bed/room tracking:** Yes — real-time occupancy monitoring and dashboards. Per-bed pricing model confirms bed-level tracking ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Real-time vacancy updates:** Yes — the AI call management system provides real-time vacancy/bed availability updates to callers ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Capacity reporting:** Yes — administrator dashboard provides "a bird's-eye view of your entire operation" with occupancy visibility ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))
- **Waitlist functionality:** Not publicly documented. No mention of waitlist features found across website or search results.
- **Inter-property transfers:** Not publicly documented. Multi-property support is confirmed ("managing a single house or overseeing dozens across multiple states"), but no explicit transfer workflow between properties mentioned ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))

---

## 3. Admissions/Intake Workflow

- **Intake process:** The AI-powered call management system handles initial inquiries, collects advocate information, and routes calls. Claims to "handle up to 70% of routine inquiries" ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Document collection during intake:** Customizable form library includes "residency agreements" and supports importing existing documentation from spreadsheets, Google Docs, and other systems ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))
- **Background checks/screening:** Not publicly documented. No mention of integrated background check functionality.
- **E-signature support for intake docs:** Not publicly documented. The platform mentions "customizable form library" but no explicit e-signature capability is described. The website marketing claims Oasis "replaces disconnected tools like e-signature tools," suggesting they may offer some form integration but details are unclear ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))

---

## 4. Billing/Payments/Ledger/Reconciliation

- **Rent collection and payment tracking:** Yes — house manager tools include rent collection and payment tracking ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))
- **Payment types supported:** Rent tracking is confirmed; other payment types (fees, deposits) not explicitly documented
- **Payment methods (card, ACH, cash):** Not publicly documented. No mention of specific payment processors like Stripe or integrated card/ACH processing
- **Ledger/accounting features:** No native ledger. Accounting is handled via integrations — QuickBooks and Xero integration available as an add-on ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Bank account automation:** Listed as an advanced add-on ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Reconciliation capabilities:** Not publicly documented as a native feature; likely handled through QuickBooks/Xero integration
- **Dunning/collections workflow:** Not publicly documented
- **Proration support:** Not publicly documented
- **Multi-payer (resident, family, sponsor):** Not publicly documented

**Assessment:** Payments appear to be a basic tracking layer rather than a full payment processing engine. The reliance on QuickBooks/Xero add-ons for accounting suggests limited native financial capabilities.

---

## 5. Resident Portal Features

- **Mobile app or PWA:** Mobile-responsive web interface confirmed ("mobile-responsive interface"). No native iOS/Android app found in App Store or Play Store searches ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))
- **Self-service features:** A resident-facing portal exists at portal.oasis.tech where "residents can view their schedule and assigned tasks" ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Profile management:** Not publicly documented beyond basic schedule/task viewing
- **Resident-facing communication:** Incident reporting and communication tools are mentioned for house managers, suggesting some resident-facing communication exists ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))

**Assessment:** Resident self-service appears limited to viewing schedules and assigned tasks. No evidence of payment portals, document signing, or comprehensive resident-facing features.

---

## 6. House Operations

- **Chore tracking/assignment:** Implied through "customizable checklists and workflows" and resident task assignments viewable in the portal ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/), [aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Meeting attendance tracking:** Yes — "sponsor meeting attendance" documentation is listed as a house manager capability ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))
- **Pass/curfew management:** Not publicly documented
- **Task assignments:** Yes — customizable checklists and workflows; residents can view assigned tasks ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Drug testing workflow/tracking:** Yes — "UA results" (urinalysis) tracking and documentation is a listed house manager feature ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))
- **Incident reporting:** Yes — customizable form library includes incident reports and grievances ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))

---

## 7. Documents & E-Sign

- **Document storage:** Yes — photo and PDF upload capabilities for resident histories. Centralized resident information repository with versioned records ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))
- **E-signature provider:** Not publicly documented. No explicit e-signature capability mentioned. Marketing mentions replacing "disconnected tools like e-signature tools," but it is unclear if Oasis provides native e-sign or simply stores signed documents ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Templates:** Yes — customizable form library with pre-built templates for incident reports, grievances, and residency agreements. DHS/AZRAH compliant form library included ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Retention policies:** Not publicly documented
- **Data migration:** Supports importing from spreadsheets, Google Docs, and other systems ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))

---

## 8. Messaging/Communications

- **In-app messaging:** Incident reporting and communication tools are mentioned, but details on messaging between staff/residents are sparse ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))
- **Announcements/broadcast:** Not publicly documented as a specific feature
- **Group chat:** Not publicly documented
- **SMS/email integration:** Automated daily/weekly email reports are sent to administrators. AI call system handles phone communications ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **AI Call Management:** This is Oasis's most distinctive communication feature — AI-powered call routing, automated call logging and transcription, emergency call prioritization, and real-time vacancy updates during calls ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))

**Assessment:** Traditional messaging (in-app, SMS, group chat) appears to be a gap. Oasis's communication strength is its AI call management system rather than resident-to-staff messaging.

---

## 9. Reporting & Dashboards

- **Occupancy reports:** Yes — real-time occupancy dashboards for administrators ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Financial reports:** Rent collection tracking; deeper financial reporting likely via QuickBooks/Xero integration ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Automated reports:** Yes — automated daily/weekly email reports ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))
- **Compliance reports:** Yes — automated and real-time reporting, DHS/AZRAH/NARR-informed ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Call analytics:** Yes — call analytics and reporting from the AI call management system ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Outcomes tracking:** Not publicly documented
- **Custom reports:** Not publicly documented

---

## 10. Permission System (RBAC) & Audit Logs

- **Role-based access control:** Yes — "role-based access control" and "assign access by role" are explicitly mentioned ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/), [aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **Specific roles:** Administrator and House Manager roles are documented with distinct tool sets. Other roles not detailed ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))
- **Audit logging detail:** Yes — "tamper-proof logs" and "complete audit trails for all actions" are highlighted as core features. "Versioned records with full accountability" ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/), [adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))
- **Multi-tenancy:** Multi-house support confirmed ("managing a single house or overseeing dozens across multiple states"). Multi-org capability not explicitly documented ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))

**Assessment:** RBAC exists but appears to have limited granularity (admin/house manager). Audit logging is heavily emphasized as a differentiator.

---

## 11. HIPAA/42 CFR Part 2 Compliance Claims

- **HIPAA compliance claims:** Uses the language "HIPAA-aligned privacy and security protections" — notably NOT claiming full HIPAA compliance, using the softer "aligned" terminology ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **42 CFR Part 2 compliance claims:** Not publicly documented. No mention of 42 CFR Part 2 found in any searched materials.
- **BAA availability:** Not publicly documented. No mention of Business Associate Agreements found.
- **SOC 2 or other certifications:** Not publicly documented. No mention of SOC 2, SOC 1, HITRUST, or other security certifications.
- **How they substantiate claims:** Compliance emphasis is on operational/regulatory compliance (Arizona DHS, AZRAH, NARR forms) rather than data security/privacy compliance. They reference "secure records, compliant documentation and forms, incident tracking, policy management, and audit support" ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))
- **DHS/AZRAH/NARR compliance:** Yes — "DHS/AZRAH Compliant Form Library" and "Arizona DHS informed design" are prominent claims. This is state-level operational compliance, not federal healthcare data privacy compliance ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))

**Assessment:** The "HIPAA-aligned" language is a significant red flag — it suggests they have not completed formal HIPAA compliance (BAA, Security Risk Assessment, encryption requirements, etc.). No 42 CFR Part 2 awareness at all, which is a major gap given the February 16, 2026 regulatory changes. Their compliance focus is Arizona DHS operational standards, not federal healthcare privacy law.

## 12. Pricing Tiers (as of February 11, 2026)

**Oasis Core — Monthly Subscription:**
- **$2.99 per bed/month**
- Includes: HIPAA-compliant resident tracking, DHS/AZRAH compliant forms, automated daily email reports, AI support, video training
- ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))

**Oasis Lifetime License:**
- **$2.99 one-time payment per bed**
- Lifetime ownership, no recurring fees
- Includes: free updates and compliance form additions, priority onboarding support, document incorporation
- ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))

**Advanced Add-Ons (custom pricing):**

- Bank account automation
- ([aiadventive.com](https://aiadventive.com/))

**Support included in all plans:**
- Email support
- 24/7 AI assistance
- Video training resources
- ([adventive.net](https://adventive.net/))

**Pricing Model:** Per-bed pricing. Extremely low price point ($2.99/bed/month or one-time) — substantially cheaper than competitors. This pricing may reflect early-stage customer acquisition strategy or limited feature depth.

**Comparison:**
- Sobriety Hub: $65/month flat fee ([sobrietyhub.com](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/pricing))
- Oasis: $2.99/bed/month (e.g., 20 beds = ~$60/month, roughly comparable)
- The lifetime license at $2.99/bed one-time is unusually aggressive and raises sustainability questions

## 13. Notable Gaps & Weaknesses

### Missing Features
1. **No native payment processing** — No integrated card/ACH payment collection; relies on external accounting software add-ons. No Stripe or payment gateway integration documented.
2. **No e-signature capability** — Despite marketing about "replacing disconnected tools," no native e-sign functionality is described.
3. **No waitlist management** — Critical for high-occupancy facilities.
4. **No 42 CFR Part 2 compliance** — Zero awareness of substance use disorder patient privacy regulations, which is alarming for software serving this exact population.
5. **Limited resident portal** — Only schedule/task viewing; no self-service payments, document signing, or communication.
6. **No native messaging** — No in-app chat, SMS integration, or broadcast announcements for residents.
7. **No pass/curfew management** — Key operational feature for sober living homes not documented.
8. **No outcomes tracking** — No program effectiveness or recovery outcome measurement.
9. **No dunning/collections workflow** — Payment follow-up processes not documented.
10. **No proration or multi-payer support** — Financial flexibility for complex billing scenarios absent.
11. **No background check integration** — Screening workflows not documented.
12. **No native mobile app** — Mobile-responsive web only, no PWA or native app.

### Compliance Gaps
- **"HIPAA-aligned" vs. HIPAA-compliant** — The hedged language suggests incomplete HIPAA implementation. No BAA, no SOC 2, no security certifications documented.
- **No 42 CFR Part 2 awareness** — The most critical gap. Software for substance use disorder housing with no mention of the primary federal regulation governing SUD patient data.
- **Arizona-centric compliance** — Form library is DHS/AZRAH-informed, which limits appeal for operators in other states.

### Market Position Weaknesses
- **Very early stage** — Founded 2023, pre-seed funding, 4 employees. Not listed in any major industry buyer's guide.
- **Dual-vertical company** — Adventive also serves restaurants with AI agents, suggesting split focus and limited domain expertise in recovery housing.
- **No independent reviews** — Not found on Capterra, G2, Software Advice, or BiggerPockets discussions.
- **Sustainability questions** — $2.99/bed lifetime license raises questions about long-term viability and ongoing development investment.

### UX/Product Concerns
- **Limited role granularity** — Only Admin and House Manager roles documented. No resident, family, sponsor, or referral partner roles evident.
- **AI-heavy approach** — 70% of calls handled by AI may not align with the personal, relationship-driven nature of recovery housing operations.
- **No multi-org support** — Multi-house confirmed but multi-organization management not documented.

### Integration Limitations
- Accounting integrations (QuickBooks/Xero) are add-ons, not included in base pricing.
- No documented integrations with EHR systems, drug testing labs, background check providers, or payment processors.

## Summary

Oasis by Adventive is a very early-stage, Arizona-focused sober living management platform with an aggressive pricing strategy and a notable AI call management differentiator. Its core strengths are operational compliance forms (DHS/AZRAH/NARR), tamper-proof audit logging, and real-time occupancy dashboards. However, it has significant gaps in payment processing, compliance (no 42 CFR Part 2, hedged HIPAA claims), resident-facing features, messaging, and document management. The 4-person team with split focus across restaurant and recovery housing verticals limits confidence in rapid feature development. As of February 2026, it is not recognized among the established sober living software competitors (Sobriety Hub, One Step, Sober Living App).
