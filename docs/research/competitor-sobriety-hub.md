## 11. HIPAA/42 CFR Part 2 Compliance Claims

| Claim | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| HIPAA compliance | Claimed | "Sobriety Hub Software is HIPAA compliant" ([FAQs](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/faqs), [Homepage](https://www.sobrietyhub.com)) |
| 42 CFR Part 2 compliance | Mentioned once | Referenced in outcomes feature description alongside HIPAA ([Outcomes & Reports](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/outcomes-reports)); not substantiated elsewhere |
| Encrypted database | Yes | "All resident and user data is stored on an encrypted AWS database" ([FAQs](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/faqs)) |
| Data sharing policy | Claimed | "Identifiable resident data will never be shared with anyone" ([FAQs](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/faqs)) |
| BAA availability | Not publicly documented | No mention of Business Associate Agreements |
| SOC 2 certification | Not publicly documented | No SOC 2 or other third-party security certifications mentioned |
| Penetration testing | Not publicly documented | No security audit or pen testing disclosures |

| Consent management | Not publicly documented | No 42 CFR Part 2 specific consent tracking or management described |

**Compliance Assessment:** Sobriety Hub claims HIPAA compliance and mentions 42 CFR Part 2 once, but provides minimal substantiation. No BAA template, no SOC 2, no third-party audit results, no detailed security architecture documentation. The compliance posture appears surface-level compared to what enterprise healthcare software typically provides. The February 16, 2026 compliance deadline for the updated 42 CFR Part 2 final rule is not addressed.

## 12. Pricing Tiers (As of February 11, 2026)

| Tier | Monthly (Annual) | Monthly (Month-to-Month) | Access Level |
|------|-----------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| **Full Staff User** | $65/month | $75/month | Full feature access, customizable permissions, multi-house management, outcomes & reports ([Pricing](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/pricing)) |
| **Client Manager** | $20/month | $25/month | 1 house only, view-only payments/forms, no outcomes, no discharged resident records ([Pricing](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/pricing)) |
| **Resident User** | Free | Free | Mobile app access for all residents ([Pricing](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/pricing)) |

**Additional Costs:**
- **Onboarding fee:** $250 one-time (includes custom form building, data migration, two consultation meetings) ([Pricing](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/pricing))

**Pricing Model:**
- Per-user (staff), NOT per-bed or per-house ([Pricing](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/pricing))
- No long-term contracts; cancel anytime ([Pricing](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/pricing))
- Users can be added/removed with automatic billing adjustments
- Free 30-day trial available (promotional code "FREE30" referenced in older content) ([Blog - Future of Sober Living](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/our-blog/sobriety-hub-is-the-future-for-sober-living-operators))

**Pricing Context:** A 3-house operator with 1 owner (Full) + 3 house managers (Client Manager) would pay: $65 + (3 x $20) = $125/month (annual) or $75 + (3 x $25) = $150/month. This is significantly cheaper than per-bed models for larger operations but could become expensive for organizations with many staff users.

**Note:** Earlier content ([Nicki's CWE Guide, Sept 2024](https://nickiscentralwestendguide.com/2024/09/meet-clay-canfield-co-founder-of-sobriety-hub/)) referenced "$5 per month per client" and older blog content referenced "$3 per bed per month" - indicating the pricing model has shifted from per-bed/per-client to per-user.

## 13. Notable Gaps & Weaknesses

### Missing Features (Opportunities for RecoveryOS)

1. **No waitlist management** - No publicly documented waitlist, referral queue, or intake pipeline functionality
2. **No bed-level tracking** - Occupancy tracked at facility level; no individual bed/room assignment, transfers between houses, or bed availability dashboard
3. **No formal ledger/accounting** - Payment tracking exists but no double-entry ledger, reconciliation tools, or accounting integration
4. **No proration** - No mid-cycle billing adjustments for early move-ins/move-outs
5. **No multi-payer workflows** - No explicit support for family, sponsor, or agency payments with split billing
6. **No deposit management** - No security deposit tracking, refund processing, or escrow
7. **No dunning escalation** - Automatic reminders exist but no formal collections escalation workflow with configurable steps
8. **No document retention policies** - No automated document lifecycle management or retention scheduling
9. **No compliance audit reports** - No dedicated HIPAA/42 CFR Part 2 compliance reporting
10. **No export/API** - No documented data export capabilities or API for third-party integrations
11. **No curfew management** - Overnight passes exist but no real-time curfew tracking or automated alerts
12. **No multi-organization architecture** - Appears to be single-org; no enterprise multi-tenant capability for management companies overseeing multiple brands
13. **No SOC 2 or third-party security certification** - HIPAA claim not substantiated with independent audits
14. **No BAA publicly available** - Critical gap for HIPAA-covered entities
15. **Weak 42 CFR Part 2 posture** - Single mention; no consent management, audit controls, or Part 2-specific features documented ahead of February 16, 2026 deadline

### UX & Platform Weaknesses

16. **Limited RBAC** - Only 3 role tiers (Full User, Client Manager, Resident); no custom role builder or granular permission matrix
17. **Client Manager restrictions are rigid** - Cannot access outcomes data or discharged residents, limiting operational flexibility
18. **iOS app not confirmed** - Only Android app found on Google Play Store; may limit resident adoption
19. **Grant-ready reports still "Coming Soon"** - Core value proposition (outcomes for grants) not fully delivered
20. **Small team (6 people)** - May struggle to maintain feature velocity and support as customer base grows

### Competitive Strengths to Note

Despite gaps, Sobriety Hub has notable strengths RecoveryOS must match or exceed:
- **Purpose-built for sober living** - Not adapted from generic CRM or EHR
- **Strong intake forms** - Conditional logic, e-signatures, auto-population, clinical assessments (BARC-10, PHQ-9, etc.)
- **Resident companion app** - Native Android app with messaging, payments, activity logging
- **Outcomes tracking** - Automated data collection from daily operations; industry-leading for this niche
- **Transparent pricing** - Simple, published, no-negotiation pricing model
- **NARR affiliate partnerships** - AzRHA and WAQRR partnerships provide distribution and credibility
- **Responsive customer support** - Consistently praised in reviews as "10/10" and "above and beyond" ([Reviews](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/reviews))
- **Active development** - Ships updates weekly; 5-person engineering team ([Sobriety Hub vs One Step](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/our-blog/which-sober-living-software-is-right-for-you))
- **Market momentum** - Claims 3x more users switched from One Step to Sobriety Hub than vice versa in 2025 ([Sobriety Hub vs One Step](https://www.sobrietyhub.com/our-blog/which-sober-living-software-is-right-for-you))

## Key Takeaway

Sobriety Hub is the fastest-growing competitor in the sober living software niche, with strong product-market fit for small-to-mid-sized operators. Their purpose-built approach, transparent pricing, resident app, and outcomes tracking differentiate them. However, they have significant gaps in financial tooling (no ledger, reconciliation, proration, deposit management), compliance substantiation (no BAA, no SOC 2, weak 42 CFR Part 2 posture), enterprise capabilities (no multi-org, limited RBAC), and operational features (no waitlist, no curfew, no bed-level tracking). RecoveryOS can compete by delivering enterprise-grade compliance, comprehensive financial management, and the multi-org architecture that Sobriety Hub lacks.
