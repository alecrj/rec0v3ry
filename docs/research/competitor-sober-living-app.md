| **Proration** | Medium | No evidence of mid-month move-in/move-out proration capabilities |
| **Reconciliation** | Medium | No bank/payment reconciliation tools documented; relies on accounting integrations (QuickBooks, Xero) |
| **Custom report builder** | Low-Medium | Customizable dashboards but no full ad-hoc report builder |

| Gap | Impact | Detail |
|-----|--------|--------|
| **No SOC 2 certification** | High | No third-party security audit or SOC 2 Type II report publicly disclosed |

### Architecture & Scalability Concerns

| **Role granularity unclear** | Medium | "Custom permissions" mentioned but specific roles and permission matrices not documented |
| **Small team** | Medium | ~8-9 employees supporting 2,000+ facilities raises questions about support capacity and development velocity |

### UX & Platform Concerns

| Gap | Impact | Detail |
|-----|--------|--------|

| **Platform complexity** | Low | Parent Behave Health platform serves treatment centers with EHR/RCM features that may be overkill for pure sober living operators |

| Gap | Impact | Detail |
|-----|--------|--------|
| **Limited documented integrations** | Medium | Only QuickBooks, Xero, Sage, NetSuite, DrFirst mentioned; no Stripe Connect, no open API documented |

---

## Summary

**Sober Living App by Behave Health** is the most established player in the recovery housing management space with strong market penetration (2,000+ facilities) and the credibility of a NARR strategic partnership. It offers a comprehensive feature set covering admissions, billing, bed management, operations, resident portal, and compliance. The platform benefits from being part of the broader Behave Health ecosystem (EHR, RCM, CRM, ERP), which provides depth in clinical features and insurance billing.

**Key strengths:** Market presence, NARR partnership, comprehensive admissions CRM, multi-payment-method billing with family portal, native mobile apps for both staff and residents, drug testing management, and accounting integrations.

**Key vulnerabilities:** Compliance claims lack independent verification (no SOC 2, no public BAA), pricing is opaque, several operational features (pass management, dunning escalation, proration, meeting attendance) are absent or underdocumented, and the small team size relative to customer base may limit support and innovation velocity.
